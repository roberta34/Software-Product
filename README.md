**Two-Dimensional Arrays in C++ â€“ High School Certification Project**

This project was developed in the senior year of high school as part of the final certification process for Computer Science and Mathematics students. It serves as a complete, interactive guide to all the theory and practical applications of bidimensional arrays (matrices) taught throughout high school.

This project walks you through everything you need to know about 2D arrays in C++, including:

- Declaration and structure

- Input and output

- Traversing matrices (including spiral order)

- Classification of matrices

- Rotation techniques

- Matrix multiplication

- Partial sums

- Dynamic memory allocation

- Algorithms and functions involving matrices

Each topic is explained through clear theory, visual examples, and code snippets to make learning effective and engaging.

**Features**

- Complete high school-level theory in one place

- Intuitive navigation via side menus

- Clean, responsive design

- Visual aids for better understanding

- C++ examples to bridge theory and code

** Technologies Used **

- HTML5

- CSS3

- Responsive design with media queries
